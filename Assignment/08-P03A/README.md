## Game Project Part1

### Prakash Tamang


### Project Description:
This is the first part of at least two others for a total of three parts. The ultimate goal is to have two characters battle with one or both sides having the ability to choose which character to battle. This will let us implement some runtime polymorphism in the final component.
